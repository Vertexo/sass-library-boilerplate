# Sass Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/user/sass-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/user/sass-library)

`library()` is a Sass mixin that helps doing something.

Short description.

Why the tool was built (optional).

## Getting started

Very simple piece of code showing the most basic usage of `library()`.

```scss
$library-default-message: 'foo';
@import 'path/to/library/index.scss';

.foo {
  @include library();
}
```

## Running tests

Clone the repository, then:

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Generating the documentation

Sass Library's API is documented using [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/).

```bash
npm run sassdoc
```

Generate & deploy the documentation to <https://user.github.io/sass-library/>:

```bash
# First time deploying the documentation?
npm run sassdoc-deploy-first-time

# Any other time:
npm run sassdoc-deploy
```
